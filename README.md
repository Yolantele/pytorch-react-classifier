## Pupper Identifier

is a machine learning Classifier following [image classification using fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson2-download.ipynb),
for those who would like to know what breed a pupper or doggo is, go to [Pupper Identiefier v.0.0.1](https://amazing-ramanujan-258157.netlify.com/)

Features:

- pyTorch model is converted and exported to JS readable format
- Machine Learning Model is loaded and run only on the Browser
- Privacy first App - no BE
- Images are Processed and evaluations generatged only on the Front-end
- No Python-based server or translator layer - only onnx model on React.js Front-end
